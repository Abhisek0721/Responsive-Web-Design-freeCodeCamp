                        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
                        JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to
                        provide programmatic control over them.

                        <br>
                        JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
                        <br>
                        ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

                    <p class="para">
                        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java.
                        You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods.
                        You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
                        <br>
                        Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                            JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. 
                            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

                            subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, 
                            letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) 
                            and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

                            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running.

                            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. 
                            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier:
                            it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
